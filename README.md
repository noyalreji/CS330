This OpenGL and C++ 3D scene features a beach at sunset, where a pyramid stands half-buried in golden sand, adorned with hieroglyphs. With swaying palm trees, gentle waves, and a colorful sunset sky, it's a captivating blend of natural beauty and ancient mystery.

Design Approach:
When it comes to designing software, my approach revolves around user-centric solutions. I aim to break down complex problems into manageable parts, ensuring that each aspect of the software functions seamlessly. This requires careful planning, thorough documentation, and a strong focus on the user experience. Ultimately, my goal is to design software that not only meets technical requirements but also exceeds user expectations.

Development Strategies:
Throughout this project, I've employed various development strategies to create an engaging 3D scene. I've dug deep into 3D graphics, mastering shader creation, 3D model handling, and optimizing scenes for real-time rendering. An iterative development approach was key, allowing me to refine and improve the project progressively. This involved continuous testing, debugging, and optimization to achieve the desired results.

Impact of Computer Science:
Computer science has played a pivotal role in enhancing my problem-solving skills and technical capabilities. In the realm of computational graphics and visualizations, it has provided me with a strong foundation to comprehend and manipulate 3D environments. These skills have a direct application in both my future educational journey and my professional career. I aspire to take on more complex challenges in software development and graphics, thanks to the knowledge and skills I've gained in this project.
